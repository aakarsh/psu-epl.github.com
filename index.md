![The EPL](/images/lab_pano_2019.png)

The EPL is a lab for rapidly prototyping electronics projects.
It is meant for students to be able to walk in with an idea and walk out with a fully functioning prototype.

The EPL is on the lower level of the **PSU Fourth Avenue Building** (FAB) at **1900 SW 4th Avenue** in room **FAB 84-20**.
Our phone number is **503-725-2879**.

# <font color="red">Lab Closure</font>
To help contain the further spread of the [COVID-19] virus,
the __EPL will be closed__ until PSU resumes a normal class schedule and activity on campus. 
This is expected to be until late April.

People will not be allowed into the lab, either through the main door or the PSAS door. 
__Managers will also not be allowed in the lab__. 
Anyone who violates this rule will lose continued access to the EPL.

We are sorry for the shutdown but have deemed it prudent to close down. 
Listed below are outside resources for your projects. 

**We also have a slack workspace for students to interact with our managers. You can ask questions about your projects, resources, Analog Discovery 2's, etc. Join us [here](https://eplabpsu.slack.com/archives/C1W89N8BY)**

## Online Resources
We understand that many students will still need to do prototyping. 
Here's a list of online vendors that will be able to help you complete your projects remotely, 
besides from the obvious ebay, Newegg, and Amazon.
