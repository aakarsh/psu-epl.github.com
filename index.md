The EPL is a lab for rapidly prototyping electronics projects.
It is meant for students to be able to walk in with an idea and walk out with a fully functioning prototype.

The EPL is on the lower level of the **PSU Fourth Avenue Building** (FAB) at **1900 SW 4th Avenue** in room **FAB 84-20**.
Our phone number is **503-725-2879**.
