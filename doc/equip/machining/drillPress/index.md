# Drill Press

The L.I.D. has a Central Machinery 10" 12-speed drill
press. It's a drill press: there's not so much to say
about it.

# Safety 

ALWAYS wear PPE (personal protective equipment) in the machine shop area, including shatterproof eye protection. Keep all loose clothing and jewelry secured, and any long hair tied back. Closed toed shoes are required to be in the machine shop area.

ALWAYS clean up your area when you are finished.

NEVER leave the chuck key in the chuck! It can turn into a dangerous projectile if the drill press is turned on while it is still in.

# Operating Procedure

## Adding Drill Bits

To add a new drill bit to the chuck, you want to start by loosening the chuck. In order to do so, hold the bottom of the chuck, and turn the top of the chuck. You will see the grips open and close. Tighten them to just large enough to hold the drill bit, and place your bit in.

Tighten them to just large enough to hold the drill bit, and place your bit in. It’s helpful to hold the bit in place with one hand and tighten with the other hand, or if you’re super cool, you can use the one handed technique shown below.

The final step is to tighten the chuck using the chuck key. Place the chuck key in the chuck and tighten it by rotating it counterclockwise.

WARNING: NEVER take your hand off the chuck key when it is in the chuck. It is supremely important that you do NOT leave the chuck key in the chuck on accident! If the drill press is turned on with the chuck key in it, it will shoot the chuck key in a random direction with high speeds.





For safety, make sure you are wearing eye protection. Keep
your fingers clear and lower the bit slowly: you'd be
surprised how easy it is to drill your finger.

Make sure that the hole in the table is centered so that the
drill bit will not hit it.

## Changing Speed

It is rarely necessary to change the drill press speed.

For safety, please unplug the drill press before changing
the speed. Otherwise, a bumped power switch could cause you
to be injured by a belt.

The belt loosening mechanism (two stop thumbscrews on either
side of the motor casing) is pretty non-functional. You will
have to just horse the top belt off the center pulley if you
want to change the bottom belt position.

# Manual

We have the manual somewhere, but I don't know how to make this wiki attach it.
