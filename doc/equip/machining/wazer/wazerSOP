Safety Information: 

It is important to realize that the Wazer can cause serious injury and it is important to not use this machine until you have been properly trained by an EPL manager. 

When using the Wazer wear eye protection (if running the Wazer for a long time hearing protection is advised). It also is advised to wear gloves when handling material because there may be sharp edges. 

The user should not leave the Wazer while it is operating. 

NEVER EVER EVER EVER EVER EVER EVER EVER EVER EVER EVER EVER OPEN THE COVER WHILE IT IS SET TO CUT. 

If the cut stops get a manager. DO NOT TRY TO FIX THE PROBLEM YOURSELF. 

Startup: 

1) First, make sure the on/off valve is on. This valve is a blue valve that is underneath the metal sink. If the valve faces in the direction of the wire the valve is on. If it is perpendicular to the wire the valve is off. 
Turn the valve so that it is in the direction of the wire if it is not in that direction already. 

2) Next, fill the tank by lifting the cover for the Wazer and fill it with water until the water level is at the top surface of the cut bed. You can fill the Water with a bucket.
  -This should not have to be done every time, only if the Wazer has not been used in a while. One should always check the water levels though.

3) The next step is to level the cut bed: Leveling cut bed is critical, as it can damage the Wazer or cause cut failure. 
  -Turn off Wazer.
  -Fill water to the top of the cut bed.
  -You may move the gantry manually and starting at the upper left-hand corner, loosen the adjustment knob (vertical one) and lower to the cut bed.
  -Using the Focusing Tool, rest the cut head on top of the lip and retighten the adjustment knob so that the Focusing Tool can move with little to no effort from under the cut head.
  -Move to the next corner and repeat. If the bed needs to be adjusted, there are screws (two on each side of the bed) that can be tightened or loosened as necessary.
  -Be sure to start off by tightening as there has to be some tension on the cut bed to prevent it from moving while cutting.
  -Repeat this process 2-3 times on each corner to make sure that the bed is leveled all across the plane.
  
4) Complete the following checklist to ensure correct functioning:
    -Secure the water Drain Hose: Make sure drain hose is correctly positioned to avoid water spilage.
    -Check for leaks: Inspect the area around the WAZER. Check all hoses and pump box for leakage.
    -Fasten WAZER power cable into corresponding outlets.
    -Posititon water Sensor Alarms: (NOTE:Water sensors are not connected to WAZER and will not stop or pause any operation.)
    
5) Prime Plumbing is always required when doing a first-time cut or left unuttended for some time. This ensures that all the air is purged from the water lines before starting your cut. (look at prime plumbing step under Preperation on pg. 52 to finish.)
 
6) Insert the SD card into the SD card slot which can be found on the top right of the Wazer just to the right of the control panel. [Insert picture from Images folder under Wazer Menu1.PNG]
        -once you select the cut file you will be asked to lift the nozzle
          -first turn the nozzle lock knob so it is losened
          -then lift the nozzle carefully by pushing it up and then tightening the nozzle lock knob
          -then hit OK on the control pattern which will hone the machine subsequently the nozzle will move to the top left corner of the cut bed. 
          
7) The next step is to fill the abrasive hopper all the way full. In order to do this pull the abrasive hopper from the left side of the wazer. Use a large cup to pur the abrasive through the two screens until you see some abrasive above the level of the screen on both sides. 
Close the abrasive hopper. 
  -Note: For long cuts you may need to add more abrasive. You can pause the cut using the built in Wazer timer; when it is paused you can add more abrasive. 

8) The next step is to empty the used abrasive buckets. These are found underneath the top front panel of the Wazer. Rotate the handles upwards and pull the used abrasive buckets out of their retainers. Subsequently, dump the used abrasive into a container that you can throw away
in the garbage. Then replace the front tank cover. Then confirm you did this step and the previous step by hitting OK on the control panel. 

9) The next step is to fasten the material with fastening screws; make sure to place enough screws to fasten the material so it does not move and such that the screws are away from the region of the material that is being cut. You can place the screws around the material and screw 
them into the cut bed.
