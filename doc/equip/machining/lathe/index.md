## Machine Safety
Read the manual and this SOP completely before operating the lathe.
Remember that you are responsible for your own safety and the safety of those near you when operating the lathe.

- Always wear safety glasses when performing ANY operation on the machine tools. Your prescription glasses are *not* safety glasses!
- Make sure that long hair is tied up and that any dangling clothing/jewelry is removed, including gloves. 
- Closed toes shoes are required at all times in the machine tool area. 
- Never use machine tools if you are alone in the lab.
- Never leave a running machine unattended.

Clamp tools securely, cutting forces are significant and can turn improperly clamped work pieces into projectiles.
Just because *you* are unable to jiggle the workpiece doesn't mean the machine will be unable to.

# Using this Machine
When you are moving the the carriage hand wheel(large black wheel on front of the lathe) can move the tool by 0.02 inches on the
either toward or away from the heatstock. Use this handwheel to position the carriage prior to starting and pull it towards you to
disengage it when you're about to start.

The cross slide feed handle(silver colored right above the carriage hand wheel) moves the cross slide in and out to make your cuts.
It makes movements of 0.001 inches 

Compound rest feed handle is used to move the tool toward or away from your workpiece in 0.001 inch incrments on the markings
