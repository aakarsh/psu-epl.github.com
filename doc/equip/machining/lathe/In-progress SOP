- Manual adjustment of cutting angles allows for tapered cuts 
- This lathe *does not* cut wood - requires a completely separate set-up

## Machine Safety
Read the manual and this SOP completely before operating the lathe.
Remember that you are responsible for your own safety and the safety of those near you when operating the lathe.

- Always wear safety glasses when performing ANY operation on the machine tools. Your prescription glasses are *not* safety glasses!
- Make sure that long hair is tied up and that any dangling clothing/jewelry is removed, including gloves. 
- Closed toes shoes are required at all times in the machine tool area. 
- Never use machine tools if you are alone in the lab.
- Never leave a running machine unattended.

Clamp tools securely, cutting forces are significant and can turn improperly clamped work pieces into projectiles.
Just because *you* are unable to jiggle the workpiece doesn't mean the machine will be unable to.
