- You can find the manual [here](manual.pdf).
- more links to manufacturer docs, calculators, outside tutorials, etc.  
It's preferred that critical documents like manuals, TDSs, and MSDSs be kept in the repo when possible/allowed.
Markdown contains a feature to define a bunch of named links at the bottom of your document.
This can make it easier to create your "useful links" list and to refer to them throughout the document.

## Machine Safety
**This is for your own safety and the safety of those around you!**
- Always wear safety glasses when performing ANY operation on the machine tools. Your prescription glasses are not safety glasses!
- Make sure that long hair is tied up and that any dangling clothing/jewelry is removed, including gloves.
- Closed toes shoes are required at all times in the machine tool area.
- Never use machine tools if you are alone in the lab.
- Do not use damaged discs! 
- No rings or jewellery are to be worn while operating this shop tool! 
- Keep fingers, hands, and power cords clear of the grinding disc. 
- Never make adjustments while the angle grinder is running. 

Be aware of flying sparks and broken discs! Always hold the grinder so that sparks fly away from you, other people, and flammable materials. The discs can shatter, ejecting themselves at high speed; this risk can be reduced if you refrain from using heavy pressure!

Improperly clamped workpieces can be grabbed by the angle grinder and ejected at high speed. Just because you are unable to jiggle the workpiece doesnâ€™t mean the machine will be unable to.
