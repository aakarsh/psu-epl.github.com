## Machine Safety
**This is for your own safety and the safety of those around you!**
- Always wear safety glasses when performing ANY operation on the machine tools. Your prescription glasses are not safety glasses!
- You *HAVE TO* wear eye protection and heavy work gloves. *NO EXCEPTIONS.*
- Make sure that long hair is tied up and that any dangling clothing/jewelry is removed, including gloves.
- Closed toes shoes are required at all times in the machine tool area.
- Never use machine tools if you are alone in the lab.
- Do not use damaged discs! 
- No rings or jewellery are to be worn while operating this shop tool! 
- Keep fingers, hands, and power cords clear of the grinding disc. 
- Never make adjustments while the angle grinder is running. 

*Be aware of flying sparks and broken discs!* Always hold the grinder so that sparks fly away from you, other people, and flammable materials. The discs can shatter, ejecting themselves at high speed; this risk can be reduced if you refrain from using heavy pressure!

*Improperly clamped workpieces can be grabbed by the angle grinder and ejected at high speed.* Just because you are unable to jiggle the workpiece doesn’t mean the machine will be unable to.

## How to Get Help
Ask a Manager if you have any questions!

# Using this Machine

### Choosing your Accessory
Disks measure between 4 and 7 inches, with 4.5 inches being most people’s preference.

- If you need to **sand** something use a Sanding Disk.
- If you need to **cut steel** use an Abrasive Grinding Disk.
- If you need to **polish** something use a Polishing Pad.
- If you need to **cut a hard surface**, such as tile, use a Diamond Blade Cut Off Disk.
- If you need to **remove excess material**, such as rust or paint, use a Wire Brush Wheel.

### Installing the Auxiliary Handle:
1. The Handle (51) can be installed in three different positions; on top, or on either side of the Gear Box (3).
2. Screw the threaded end of the Handle into the selected position. Tighten securely before beginning work.

### Adjusting the Guard:
1. Depending on where the Handle is mounted; the Guard may have to be moved. Adjust the Guard (15) to the proper position for the intended operation before installing a grinding wheel or other disc.
2. Loosen the screws in the collar of the Guard and rotate to the position desired.

### Installing a Grinding Wheel:
1. Before installing a grinding wheel, review Machine Safety.
2. Verify that the Grinding Wheel meets the following:
	- Rated to at least 10,000 RPM
	- No larger than 4 ½ inch in diameter
	- Titted with a 7/8 inch round arbor hole
	- ¼ inch thick or less
	- A type of grinding wheel suitable for surface grinding, not edge grinding
	- Clean and dry
	- Undamaged
3. Press in and hold the Spindle Lock (1) to prevent the Spindle (17) from turning.
4. Remove the Outer Flange (20). Keep the Inner Flange (18) in position on the Spindle.
5. Slip the Grinding Wheel onto the Spindle with a paper gasket, or blotter, first. The blotter should be centered on the grinding wheel and the wheel and blotter should rest flat against the Inner Flange.  NOTE: The blotters help prevent grinding wheel damage and wheel slippage. Use these to prevent serious injury.
6. Thread the Outer Flange Arbor Nut onto the Spindle. Wrench tighten only enough so that the wheel is securely held on the spindle. *Do Not Overtighten*.

### Installing a Threaded Accessory:
1. Before installing please review the Machine Safety section. The accessory must meet the following: 
	- rated to at least 10,000 RPM
	- no larger than 4 ½ inch in diameter
	- fitted with a 7/8 inch round arbor hole
	- ¼ inch thick or less
	- a type of grinding wheel suitable for surface grinding, not edge grinding
	- clean and dry
	- undamaged
2. Press in and hold the Spindle Lock Button to prevent the Spindle from turning.
3. Remove the Outer Flange and Inner Flange and keep in a safe place.
4. Thread disc accessory firmly onto the Spindle. Wrench tighten onto the Spindle.

## Operation 
Choose a disc that is the best fit for your project. There are sanding disks, abrasive grinding disks (to cut steel), polishing pads, wire brush wheels (used to remove excess material like rust or paint) and diamond blade cut off disks (used to cut hard surfaces such as tile). Disks measure between 4 and 7 inches, with 4.5 inches being most people’s preference.

When you are ready to begin follow these steps: 
1. Verify that you have secured the piece you are working on into place (clamps work well). 
2. Power on the angle grinder by pulling on the Safety Switch (41) back, then squeeze the Paddle Trigger (43). 
3. The disk must be spinning before you apply it to your working surface. Be sure you allow the angle grinder to reach operating speed before using it.
4. Apply the wheel to the work piece and increase the load gradually. 
	- NOTE: Your grasp should be firm so that you have full control of the direction in which the angle grinder is moving. 
	- NOTE: If the tool bogs down, use lighter pressure.
	- NOTE: To create a smoother surface, keep the tool moving over the work surface.
5. Release the Paddle Trigger to stop the tool.
6. Allow the tool to come to a complete stop before setting it down.

*Remember, do not leave the angle grinder running and only use the grinder when it is in your hands.*

When you are done, gently lift the angle grinder, shut off the power, and set the angle grinder down in a safe place. Do not touch your work piece immediately after grinding operation as it may be extremely hot.

## Shutdown
Turn off and unplug the angle grinder and make sure the disk is still in good condition after usage. Remember to not touch the work piece immediately after grinding operation as it may be extremely hot. 

## Cleanup
- Grinder must be turned off *and unplugged* when being cleaned, adjusted, maintained, or repaired. 
- Do not lift or drag angle griders by the cord.
- Clean up your workstation!
- After use, clean the external surfaces of the tool with a clean cloth. Never use solvents or harsh cleaners as they may damage the housing. To prevent electrical shock, do not allow water or other liquids to enter the motor vent holes in the Gear Housing.
- Be sure to store the tool in the black cabinet and *clean up your workstation.*

# Tips and Tricks
## Ring-Test 
A ring-test will verify that a disc is undamaged. Perform this test on the wheel (unless wheel is smaller than 4 inches or is an unusual shape) as follows:
1. Suspend wheel using a pin or finger through the arbor hole.
2. <img src="/doc/equip/shop/angleGrinder/ringtest.jpg" width="400">
3. Tap the flat side of the wheel with a light non-metallic object.
