## Machine Safety
**This is for your own safety and the safety of those around you!**
- Always wear safety glasses when performing ANY operation on the machine tools. Your prescription glasses are not safety glasses!
- You *HAVE TO* wear eye protection and heavy work gloves. *NO EXCEPTIONS.*
- Make sure that long hair is tied up and that any dangling clothing/jewelry is removed, including gloves.
- Closed toes shoes are required at all times in the machine tool area.
- Never use machine tools if you are alone in the lab.
- Do not use damaged or broken drill bit! 
- Keep fingers, hands, and power cords clear of the drill bits. 

*Be aware of a bit jumping off of your material and into somewhere you don't want it. Slower speeds and proper sized bits can help make working with this tool safer
