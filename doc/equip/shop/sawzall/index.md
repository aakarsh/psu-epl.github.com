## Setup
Disconnect the battery pack from the tool before making any adjustments or changing blades. Make sure the tool is in the off or locked position before inserting the battery pack! If you notice misalignment, blade breakage, or any other damage find a Manager to ensure the tool is safe to use. If you need to replace a blade make sure the tool is off with the battery pack removed before changing. There are several types of blades in the machine tool area, make sure you are using the correct one for the Sawzall. If in doubt, ask a Manager!

Use clamps or other practical ways to secure and support your work piece; using your hands or body to hold a work piece will lead to loss of control and injury, use clamps.

### To replace the blade
- Remove the battery pack.
- Use a 5mm hex tool to loosen the blade clamp screw enough to permit the saw blade to be inserted between the blade clamp and saw bar. Note: It is never necessary to remove the blade clamp screw from the blade clamp when installing or removing the blade.

- Align the hole in the shank of the blade and blade clamp with the pin in the saw bar, then seat both on the pin in the saw bar.
- Tighten the blade clamp screw securely. Do not overtighten the screw.

## Operation

### For General Cutting (wood products, masonite, plastics, or drywall)
![sawzallGeneralCutting](/doc/equip/shop/sawzall/sawzallGeneralCutting.jpg)

Once you are ready to begin your project hold the saw firmly in front of and clearly away from you. Make sure the saw blade is clear of any foreign material. Be sure your work piece is secured (with clamps *not hands*) before cutting.

You must press the lock button in order to pull the trigger to turn on the saw! The lock button will reset each time the trigger is released. This tool also has a variable speed which delivers higher speed with increased trigger pressure. Make sure the blade has reached full speed before beginning your cuts!

Place the base assembly (guard) against the work piece, then move the blade into the work piece.

Do not force the tool, be patient when cutting through your work piece. Let the blade and saw do the work for you! Use of excessive pressure causes bending and twisting of the blade and may result in injury. If you see any instability in your work piece, *immediately* turn off the Sawzall and adjust the clamps to reduce risks.

### For Plunge Cutting (cutting out openings in wood products, masonite, plastics, or drywall)

Once you are ready to begin your project hold the saw firmly in front of and clearly away from you. Make sure the saw blade is clear of any foreign material. Be sure your work piece is secured (with clamps *not hands*) before cutting.

You must press the lock button in order to pull the trigger to turn on the saw! The lock button will reset each time the trigger is released. This tool also has a variable speed which delivers higher speed with increased trigger pressure. Make sure the blade has reached full speed before beginning your cuts! Choose a convenient starting point inside the area to be cut out and place the tip of the blade over that point. Place the base assembly (guard) against the work piece, then move the blade into the work piece.

Once the saw blade is at full cutting speed, slowly tilt it downward until the tip of the blade starts cutting the work piece. After the blade penetrates the work piece, tilt the saw until the blade is perpendicular to the work piece. This will result in the best plunge for your project.

Do not force the tool, be patient when cutting through your work piece. Let the blade and saw do the work for you! Use of excessive pressure causes bending and twisting of the blade and may result in injury. If you see any instability in your work piece, *immediately* turn off the Sawzall and adjust the clamps to reduce risks.

### For Metal Cutting (sheet steel, pipe, steel rods, aluminum, brass, or copper)
![sawzallMetal](/doc/equip/shop/sawzall/sawzallMetal.jpg)

Once you are ready to begin your project hold the saw firmly in front of and clearly away from you. Make sure the saw blade is clear of any foreign material.

Be sure your work piece is secured (with clamps *not hands*) before cutting. *For Metals* clamp the work firmly and cut close to the clamping point to eliminate any vibration of the work piece being cut. When cutting conduit pipe or angle iron, clamp the work piece in a vise if possible and cut close to the vise. To cut thin sheet material, ‘sandwich’ the material between hardboard or plywood and clamp the layers to eliminate vibration and material tearing.

You must press the lock button in order to pull the trigger to turn on the saw! The lock button will reset each time the trigger is released. This tool also has a variable speed which delivers higher speed with increased trigger pressure. Make sure the blade has reached full speed before beginning your cuts!

Metals have an increased risk of twisting or bending the saw blade. Using cutting oil is recommended; this will keep the blades cool, increase cutting action, and prolong the blade life.

Place the base assembly (guard) against the work piece, then move the blade into the work piece.

Do not force the tool, be patient when cutting through your work piece. Let the blade and saw do the work for you! Use of excessive pressure causes bending and twisting of the blade and may result in injury. If you see any instability in your work piece, *immediately* turn off the Sawzall and adjust the clamps to reduce risks.
