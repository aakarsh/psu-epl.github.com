## Setup
Before each use, inspect the general condition of the tool. Check for:
- Loose hardware
- Misalignment or binding of moving parts
- Cracked or broken parts
- Damaged electrical wiring
- Any other condition that may affect its safe operation.

If abnormal noise or vibration occurs, have a Manager fix the problem corrected before further use. Do not use damaged equipment.

### Check and Align Bevel Indicator: 
1. Loosen Table Lock Knob (44) and move the table until it is approximately perpendicular (right angle) to the blade. 
1. Use a small combination square to set the table at 90 degrees to the blade.
1. Tighten the Table Lock Knob (44).
1. Loosen Pan Screw (14) holding the bevel Scale Indicator (13), and adjust Indicator topoint to "0" degrees. 
1. Retighten Pan Screw.
Tip: The bevel Scale Indicator (13) is a guide and should not be relied upon for precision settings. Make practice cuts in scrap wood to determine if the angle settings are correct.

### Table Angle Adjustment:
The Saw Table (53) can be adjusted between 0 and 45 degrees as follows:
1. Loosen Table Lock Knob (44) and move the table until the desired angle is reached as indicated on the Bevel Scale (15).
1. Tighten the Table Lock Knob (44).

### Removing and Installing Blades:
Refer to the Material Guide to verify that the blade is appropriate for your work piece.

1. Loosen the Blade Tension Knob (21) by turning counterclockwise about two full turns.
1. Push down slightly on the Upper Rocker Arm (29) and remove Saw Blade (45) from Upper Blade Holder (37) by pulling forward.
1. Remove Blade from Lower Blade Holder (40) and pull up through the access hole. **Note: The Saw Blade must be installed so that its teeth are facing forward (front cutting), or to the side (side cutting), and always pointing down.**
1. Attach a new (5") Saw Blade through access holeand hook pins into Lower Blade Holder (40).
1. Attach upper Saw Blade hook pins into the Upper Blade Holder (37). Make sure the pins of the Blade are in the slots of the Blade Holders.
1. Tighten the Blade Tension Knob (21) by turning clockwise about two full turns.

Note: The Blade is at the proper tension when the slack is just barely removed. Over or under tensioning of the blade causes premature breakage during operation. 

## Operation
**Don't force the tool.** It will do the job better and safer at the rate for which it was designed.

**Use the right blade.** Don't force tool or attachmentto do a job for which it was not designed.

**Make sure you are feeding your work piece in the correct direction.** Feed work into a blade or cutter against the direction of rotation of the blade or cutter only.

**NEVER LEAVE TOOL RUNNING UNATTENDED. TURN POWER OFF.** Don't leave tool until it comes to a complete stop

### Turning On and Adjusting Speed:
1. Insert Switch Key into On/Off Switch (72).
1. To turn saw On, place finger on leftside of switch and push right.
1. To turn saw Off, place finger on rightside of switch and push left.
1. Turn the Variable Speed Knob (81) clockwise to increase the stokes per minute.
1. To lock switch in Off position. WARNING: Keep hands and fingers away from the moving Saw Blade.

### Straight, Cross, Bevel cuts, and Ripping:
1. Using a pencil, mark the cut-line on the workpiece.
1. Slide the workpiece underneath the Workpiece Foot (48). If necessary, adjust the Workpiece Foot by loosening the Workpiece Foot Lock Knob (68) and sliding the Workpiece Foot (up or down) until it lightly rests on the workpiece. Tighten the Workpiece Foot Lock Knob (68)
1. Set the On/Off Switch (72) to the On position. The Saw Blade starts moving.
1. Using both hands, carefully guide the workpiece into the blade to cut. Press down on the workpiece and slowly guide it through the Saw Blade (45). Do not force the material through the Blade or the Blade could break.

### Inside Cuts:
1. Using a pencil, mark the cut-line on the workpiece.
1. Drill a 1/4" hole in the workpiece.
1. Follow the procedures for removing and installing the Saw Blade (45) as described in Setup.
1. Place the workpiece on the Saw Table (53) so that the hole is centered over the Blade access hole.
1. Insert the Blade through the hole in the work piece and the Saw Table (53).
1. Reinstall the Blade and properly adjust tension. Make sure Bladeteeth are facing forward and down.
1. While holding the work piece with one hand, set the On/Off Switch (72) to the On position.
1. Hold the workpiece with both hands while guiding and pressing down on the workpiece until the cut is complete.
1. Set the On/Off Switch to the Off position.
1. Follow the procedures for removing and installing the Saw Blade (45) as described in Setup.
1. With the Blade removed, the workpiececan be removed from the Saw Table.
1. Reinstall the Blade and set the proper tension as described in Setup.

### Curved Cuts:
1. Mark the entire cutting line with a pencil. If a template is available, use it as a marking guide.
1. Slide the work piece underneath the Drop Foot (48) without touching the Saw Blade (45).
1. Set the On/Off Switch (72) to the On position.
1. Using both hands, carefully guide the work piece into the Saw Blade to cut. Press down on the work piece and slowly guide it through the Blade. Do not force the material through the Blade. When cutting curves, be careful not to twist the Blade out of line
1. If the curve cut is forced off the cut-line, back the material off the Saw Blade and start a new, straightcut through a scrap section of the material. Begin the curved cut again from an appropriate angle point.
1. Set the On/Off Switch (72) to the Off position when finished cutting.

### Jamming of Saw Blade and Workpiece:
1. When the Saw Blade (45) jams in the work piece, immediately press the On/Off Switch (72) to the Off position, and unplug the Line Cord from the electrical outlet.
1. Wait until the Saw Blade has come to a complete stop, then remove the Saw Blade as described in Removing and Installing the Blade. The workpiece will come with it.
1. Place a flat bladed screwdriver in the cut and force it open. Remove the Saw Blade.
1. Reinstall the Saw Blade on the machine as described in Setup.

## Shutdown
Press the On/Off Switch (72) to the Off position!

## Cleanup
When you are done with your project, wipe the external surfaces of the tool with clean cloth and vacuum up any dust.

# Tips and Tricks
Always plug this saw into a three-prong outlet; the ground pin is required for this tool.

Applying a light coat of paste wax on the Saw Table allows the material being cut to glide smoothly across the Saw Table (53) surface. Buff the wax off with a clean cloth after application.

Over time, if the performance of the Scroll Saw diminishes, or it stops working completely, it may be necessary to replace the Carbon Brushes in the Motor (51) by removing the Carbon Brush Holder (84) and inspecting the Carbon Brushes (83). This procedure should be completed by a qualified technician. If the Carbon Brushes are not worn down, try cleaning the Carbon Brush tips with an ink eraser.
