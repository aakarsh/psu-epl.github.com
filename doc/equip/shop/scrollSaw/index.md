# Using this Machine
The Scroll Saw can use a variety of blade widthsand thicknesses, as long as they are 5" long and have the cross pin for mounting. These are used for cutting various types of materials as listed below:

<br />

| Teeth/Inch | Width | Tickness | Material cut |
|------------|-------|----------|--------------|
| 10 | 0.11'' | 0.02'' | Medium turns on 1/4'' to 1-3/4'' wood, soft metals, wallboard, hardboard. |
| 15 | 0.11'' | 0.02'; | Same as above except for wood. Cuts wood from 1/8'' to 1-1/2'' thick. |
| 18 | 0.095'' | 0.1'' | Extra thin cuts on soft woods and other materials up to 1/4''. |

## Setup
Before each use, inspect the general condition of the tool. Check for:
- Loose hardware
- Misalignment or binding of moving parts
- Cracked or broken parts
- Damaged electrical wiring
- Any other condition that may affect its safe operation.

If abnormal noise or vibration occurs, have a Manager fix the problem corrected before further use. Do not use damaged equipment.

### Check and Align Bevel Indicator: 
1. Loosen Table Lock Knob (44) and move the table until it is approximately perpendicular (right angle) to the blade. 
1. Use a small combination square to set the table at 90 degrees to the blade.
1. Tighten the Table Lock Knob (44).
1. Loosen Pan Screw (14) holding the bevel Scale Indicator (13), and adjust Indicator topoint to "0" degrees. 
1. Retighten Pan Screw.
Tip: The bevel Scale Indicator (13) is a guide and should not be relied upon for precision settings. Make practice cuts in scrap wood to determine if the angle settings are correct.

### Table Angle Adjustment:
The Saw Table (53) can be adjusted between 0 and 45 degrees as follows:
1. Loosen Table Lock Knob (44) and move the table until the desired angle is reached as indicated on the Bevel Scale (15).
1. Tighten the Table Lock Knob (44).

### Removing and Installing Blades:
Refer to the Material Guide to verify that the blade is appropriate for your work piece.

1. Loosen the Blade Tension Knob (21) by turning counterclockwise about two full turns.
1. Push down slightly on the Upper Rocker Arm (29) and remove Saw Blade (45) from Upper Blade Holder (37) by pulling forward.
1. Remove Blade from Lower Blade Holder (40) and pull up through the access hole. **Note: The Saw Blade must be installed so that its teeth are facing forward (front cutting), or to the side (side cutting), and always pointing down.**
1. Attach a new (5") Saw Blade through access holeand hook pins into Lower Blade Holder (40).
1. Attach upper Saw Blade hook pins into the Upper Blade Holder (37). Make sure the pins of the Blade are in the slots of the Blade Holders.
1. Tighten the Blade Tension Knob (21) by turning clockwise about two full turns.

Note: The Blade is at the proper tension when the slack is just barely removed. Over or under tensioning of the blade causes premature breakage during operation. 

## Operation
**Don't force the tool.** It will do the job better and safer at the rate for which it was designed.

**Use the right blade.** Don't force tool or attachmentto do a job for which it was not designed.

**Make sure you are feeding your work piece in the correct direction.** Feed work into a blade or cutter against the direction of rotation of the blade or cutter only.

**NEVER LEAVE TOOL RUNNING UNATTENDED. TURN POWER OFF.** Don't leave tool until it comes to a complete stop

# Tips and Tricks
Always plug this saw into a three-prong outlet; the ground pin is required for this tool.

Applying a light coat of paste wax on the Saw Table allows the material being cut to glide smoothly across the Saw Table (53) surface. Buff the wax off with a clean cloth after application.

Over time, if the performance of the Scroll Saw diminishes, or it stops working completely, it may be necessary to replace the Carbon Brushes in the Motor (51) by removing the Carbon Brush Holder (84) and inspecting the Carbon Brushes (83). This procedure should be completed by a qualified technician. If the Carbon Brushes are not worn down, try cleaning the Carbon Brush tips with an ink eraser.
