# About this Machine
These tools are useful for making small, detailed cuts and removing sharp edges/burrs from parts.
They're like angle grinders, but really tiny.

With enough patience and manual dexterity, they can do almost anything.
With the appropriate choice of cutting head, they can cut everything from soft plastics and wood to hardened steel.

The 8220 and 4000 models are essentially the same tool, one just has a battery and the other has a cord.

## Machine Safety
This is a tiny spinning cutter. It can give you lacerations, throw metal chips into people's eyes, or grab loose things.

- Always wear safety glasses when working with or around this machine.
    - **Your reading glasses are not safety glasses!**
- Always keeps your hands away from the cutting head when using running this machine.
- Always tie back or tuck in long hair, jewelry, long sleeves, et cetera that could get caught in the blade. 
- Always be prepared for the cutting head to grab the part and throw the part/tool.
- Always be prepared for the cutting head to break apart (especially the abrasive discs).
- Never put any part of your body in the path of the blade.
- Never leave the machine plugged in after you're done using it.

## How to Get Help
TODO: Include a list of which documents, websites, people, or mailing lists should be consulted in case of problems.

**In the case of equipment failure or operation concerns, turn off the rotary tool, remove or unplug the power source for the rotary tool, and communicate with an EPL manager immediately.** 

# Using this Machine
These sections describe the standard usage and common pitfalls.

- **IMPORTANT:** Always start by making sure your hair or jewelry will not get caught in the tool. Next, be sure to equip the proper safety gear including: Safety Glasses, Dust Mask (if applicable), and Gloves (if cutting fiberous material or metals)

## Choosing a Cutting Head
There are a lot of available attachments for these tools.
Only some of them may be available in the lab.
If you need a specialized tool, you may need to purchase it yourself or ask a manager if the lab can purchase one.

### Sanding Drums
These are just cylinders of sand paper. 
They're useful for smoothing rough edges and removing small amounts of material.
They aren't suitable for removing lots of material, since they wear out quickly.
Don't run these head excessively fast in flammable materials like wood or plastic, since they generate a lot of heat.

#### Replacing a Sanding Drum
These drums are disposable, however their holders are usually __not disposable__.

1. Make sure the tool is unplugged and turned off.
1. Hold down the spindle locking button, just above the power switch.
1. Loosen the fastener on the end of the drum holder.
1. Slide the drum off of the holder and replace it with a new drum.
1. Tighten the fastener on the end of the holder.

### Diamond Burrs
These are just pieces of metal with diamonds embedded in the surface.
These are good for removing small amounts of hard materials.
These should not be used on soft metals like aluminum, copper, or brass. 
Those metals tend to clog the tool.

### Abrasive Discs
These are made of a very hard dust held together with some sort of binder.
They are good for making thin cuts in any material.
These heads are usually very delicate and can fly apart during use.
You can help prevent this by making straight cuts and not changing the orientation of the cutting plane.
These are only meant to _cut on the edge of the disk_, not the face!

### Grinding Stones
These are like abrasive discs, but thicc and usually more coarse.
These play a similar role to sanding drums. 
They're a little more durable than drums or discs, and more expensive.

### Cutters
These have cutting blades and work similar to an end mill.
They're good for removing lots of material from wood, plastic, and soft metal.

### Burrs
These are similar to cutters but with "claws" instead of blades.
They're good for removing lots of soft material, like wood or plastic.
They leave a rough surface finish.

### Brushes
__These should not be run above 15 000 RPM (half speed)!__
Running brushes at higher speed can eject the wires.

These are a bunch of wires.
Metal brushes are used to remove surface corrosion and leave a nice "brushed" surface.
Plastic brushes are good for cleaning.
Be aware than wires will occasionally fly off of the brush during use.
You can mitigate this by only applying gentle pressure.
"Mashing" the brush into your work piece will case excessive wear on the brush.

### Polishing Wheels
These are usually made of felt or sewn layers of cotton fabric.
They can be charged/impregnated with abrasive compound to polish parts.
You can get a mirror finish this way.

### Drills
These are just ordinary twist drills.
It can be difficult to keep a rotary tool straight when drilling.
If you can, [consider using the drill press instead](/doc/equip/machining/drillPress).

## Setup
TODO: Describe how to check that the machine is okay to use.
TODO: Describe make the machine ready to use.

### Removing a Cutting Head
1. Make sure the tool is off and unplugged.
1. Hold down the spindle locking button, just above the power switch.
1. Use the small wrench to loosen the collet at the end of the tool. 
   This is the knurled bit that spins with the cutting head.
1. Remove the cutting head. If it's an abrasive disc, be careful not to pull on the disc itself.

### Attaching a Cutting Head
1. Insert the cutting head into the spindle.
    - You may need to loosen the collet a little.
1. Hold down the spindle locking button, just above the power switch.
1. Use the small wrench to tighten the collet . 

## Operation
TODO: Show how to actually *do the thing*.
- Before applying the tool bit to the material, turn on the rotary tool and visually confirm the bit is not off center when rotating. 
- If possible, secure your workpiece using a clamp or vice as the rotary tool can create a lot of kickback.
- Be sure to choose the appropriate speed for the bit and material. A rule of thumb is: if you see smoke or discoloration of the material, the speed is set too high. It is advised that you make several passes on a material when doing a cutting operation.
- For the first time operation of a rotary tool, it is usefull to do a test cut on some plastic or scrap material to get a feel for how the initial cut glides as well as how the bite into the material feels.

## Cleanup
1. Set the tool to the lowest speed setting, and make sure the power switch is in the off position.
1. Let a manager know if a cutting head was damaged or broken while you were using this machine.
    - If you think something was too damaged to be put back in the kit, let a manager know.
1. Return all cutting heads and accessories to the tool kit(s).
1. Clean and return the tool kit(s) and rotary tool to the tool cabinet.
1. Vacuum up the work area, including any surrounding work areas which may have collected dust/cuttings/swarf.
    - Leave the lab a little bit cleaner than you found it! ðŸ˜‡

# Tips and Tricks
TODO: List some sections describing advanced techniques.
 - Let the tool do the work: The speed of the tool should be doing the work on the material, NOT the force you apply. It is better to make multiple passes to maintain control over the workpiece.
 - Sand in the same direction the tool tip is spinning, this creates the smoothest finish when sanding.
 - Cut against the direction the tool tip is spinning, be ready for the tool tip to try and climb up the piece your working on. 
 - If you have a stripped screw head, you can use a cutting tool to create a notch across the screw head to then back out the screw with a flathead.
 - For fitted pins or connectors, it can be helpful to round off the tips to prevent jams
 - If you are cutting glass, you will need to use a diamond bit at a slow speed with lubricant. Only apply light pressure and every few seconds, back out the cutting bit and relubricate the bit. 
 - It is possible to create a fence guide to help create straight lines and cuts with the rotary tool.
