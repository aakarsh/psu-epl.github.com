# About this Machine
This Belt Sander is a Central Machinery (Harbor Freight) Model 69033. This machine includes both a 1 by 30 inch belt and a 5 inch disc. 

Which one should you use? Both can be used to sand wood, removing hardened glue, deburr metal, sharpen tools, or polish plastic or glass. A belt sander is best for removing a lot of material quickly while the disc sander is best for finishing surfaces.

It’s typically recommended that you use the belt sander for rough and fast jobs followed by the disc sander for a smoother finish.

## Operation
Once you have made your adjustments you will need to secure your work piece as best as you can. Remember to *NOT WEAR GLOVES*.

To operate:
1. Verify that there are no foreign objects or cords near the belt or disc!
2. Check that the ON/OFF Switch is off, then plug the Power Cord into a grounded outlet.
3. Turn the ON/OFF Switch ON.
4. Wait for the sanding surfaces to come up to full speed.
5. Holding the workpiece firmly on the table surface, slide the workpiece into contact with the sanding surface by applying light pressure against the sanding surface. NOTE: Only contact the downward side of the rotating sanding disc. Bringing the workpiece in contact with the upward rotation of the disc may cause the workpiece to fly up or kickback which may result in injury.
6. Once you are done turn off the tool and disconnect its power supply after use.

### Disc Sanding Tips
- Always use the Sander on the downward rotating half of the Sanding Disc.
- Use the Sanding Disc for sanding the ends of small and narrow workpieces and outside curved edges.
- Contact the sanding surface with light pressure, keeping aware of what part of the disc you are contacting. The outer edge of the disc moves faster and removes more material than the area of the Sanding Disc closer to the center of the Disc.

### Belt Sanding Tips
- Use the Belt Sanding surface to sand wood, deburr metal, or polish plastic or glass.
- When sanding flat surfaces, keep the Backstop installed so the workpiece contacts a straight flat sanding surface.
- When sanding curved surfaces, remove the backstop or back it off, so the Belt will have some give, and will better contact the curved edges of the workpiece.
- When sharpening a metal tool:
	- Keep the Backstop in place for a firm sanding surface.
	- Adjust the Belt Table to the desired angle of the Tool.
	- Hold the tool firmly on the Belt Table top and slide the tool toward the sanding surface making light contact until the bevel is sharpened.

## Shutdown
Be sure to turn off the tool *and* disconnect its power supply after use.

## Cleanup
After use, wipe the external surfaces of the tool with a clean cloth. Clean up your workstation before leaving!
