# Using this Machine
There are many things this system can clean and there are some items that may be damaged during the cleaning process. Make sure your item is not on the folliwng list. 

### Cleaning Warnings!
*Use your best judgement when using this cleaner. You are responsible for what you put inside of it!!*
- *Soft Jewelry*; pearls, emeralds, ivory, coral, agate, sea turtle shells, etc. 
..- These items are not hard, so scratches may occur during cleaning.
- *Welded, Plated, or Glued Items.* 
..- Ultrasonic cleaning may increase the gaps inside the welded joints, plated coating, or glued items and may cause separation.
- *Watches*; except diver’s watches with depth rating over 150 ft (50 m)
..- Because of the strong penetration capability of the ultrasonic waves, water may get into the watches if they are not truly waterproof. 
- *Others*; glass, ceramic, camera filters with cracks, eyeglasses, sunglasses with poor coating.
..- Ultrasonic cleaning may increase the cracks in the coating on the glasses, ceramic, and glass. If items have no pre-existing cracks, then it is okay.

## Setup
There are a few ways to perform cleaning and it largely depends on the item itself. See the following diagram and quick start instructions and Operation for the full procedure,

## Operation
Refer to setup for quick start instructions.
### Regular Cleaning
Regular cleaning is best suited for everyday items such as metal tools. Only tap water is needed.
1. Add water to the cleaning tank to the level between “MIN” and “MAX” lines and above the area to be cleaned.
1. Put the item/s to be cleaned inside the basked or directly in the cleaning tank.
..- The basket reduces the friction between the items and the tank but it absorbs about 30% of the ultrasonic energy and reduces the cleaning effect.
1. Press SET button to set the timer 5 to 10 minutes. 
1. Press On/Off button to start cleaning.
1. During cleaning, debris will come off the items like “smoke”. Water will become murky. The cleaning is done when the smoke is no longer visible.
1. Replace the water to wash other items.

### Indirect cleaning
Indirect cleaning is best suited for more complex items. The liquids used differ depending on the item. For instance, watches will need watch oil (to prevent rust), printing tools will need acetone (to dissolve ink), electronics will need alcohol (to evaporate quickly), and ‘home’ items will need rubbing alcohol (to remove odor, clean, and disinfect.). You will need to use your best judgement on what kind of liquid to use depending on your item.
NOTE: If you use acetone avoid coming in contact with the plastic housing to prevent corrosion. Also use a glass or metal container for the items/acetone.
1. Put the items in a separate container.
1. Add the proper type of fluid into the container to submerge the item to be cleaned.
1. Place the container in the tank.
1. Add tap water to the cleaning tank to the level between “MIN” and “MAX” lines but *not* over the container.
1. Press SET button to set the timer to 10 minutes.
1. Press On/Off button to start cleaning. The ultrasonic waves will penetrate the container and clean the item.
