# About this Machine
~~////////////////////////////////![picture of the machine]({{ site.url }}/images/kitten.jpg)~~

The HUMMER II performs sputter coating, a cold process in which ions impacting a metal source dislodge metal atoms. The atoms disperse throughout the process chamber to uniformly coat irregularly shaped specimens without thermal damage. Sputter coating produces high quality coatings whose thickness is repeatable and easily controlled. Cold, fast sputter rates require less time, giving you more time for microscope examinations. 

The HUMMER II has three operating modes: 
1. Plate Mode – to plate a specimen with a metal
1. Etch Mode – to remove material from a specimen
1. Plasma Mode – to clean a specimen or for crosslinking of organic specimens

Any of these three modes can be operated in “Pulse mode” (repeated on-off pattern) to avoid the aggregation of material in localized place and to reduce the specimen heating. Typical process cycle 3 minutes, coat 2 minutes, release to atmospheric pressure 15 seconds.

*The HUMMER II uniformly deposits gold/palladium, platinum, palladium, carbon, chrome, copper, nickel, and other metals. Metals, organic and ceramics are uniformly cleaned and/or etched in conjunction with coating.*

# Using this Machine
~~///////////////////////////insert picture of control panel~~

This system has the following controls and functions:

- *“Vent Valve”* – Used to vent the chamber to atmospheric pressure, allowing removal or replacement of specimens within the chamber. Leave the vent valve open when the pump is not in operation.
- *“Gas Valve”* – Used to introduce air or inert gases into the vacuum chamber and to regulate the pressure within the chamber. Vent valve must be closed in order for this valve to function. Only light two finger pressure is required to close this valve. *Excessive force will damage this valve.*
- *“Main Power Switch”* – Used to turn on the vacuum pump, vacuum gauge, and power supply. The amber light indicated that the power is on.
- *“High-Voltage Switch”* – Used to adjust the amount of high-voltage required.
- *“Auto-Manual Switch”* – Used to select either manual operation or automatically timed operation. Note: The high voltage light will not come on if the switch is in automatic position and the timer is set at zero.
- *“Mode Switch Plate-Etch-Plasma”* – Used to select mode of operation for either DC plating, DC cleaning or etching, or plasma processing. 
- *“Pulse Switch”* – Used for intermittent pulsing of the plasma to provide smallest coating crystal nucleation and lowest rise of the specimen temperature. After turning on the pulse mode, it takes 30 seconds for warm up after which an on-off interval of 5 seconds will continue. Pulse can be selected in either automatic or manual mode.
- *“Vacuum Pump Gas Ballast Valve”* – The gas ballast valve is operated by means of a knurled knob at the rear of the cabinet. Its use is to purge the vacuum pump oil of water and other volatile contamination. Normally, this valve is fully closed (turned clockwise to stop), approximately 1 time per month turn the kurnled knob ¾ turn counter clockwise and run the vacuum pump under vacuum approximately 1 hour to vent all volatile contaminants. Retighten the valve to its original position.
- *“Pressure Switch”* – Used as a safety device to cut off high voltage whenever chamber is at atmosphere.

## Setup
Verify that the glass vacuum chamber is placed securely in the groove in the baseplate and that the top plate is in position on the chamber top. Make sure that the contact areas of the chamber and gaskets are free from dirt, dust, and other contamination. There may be a light film of silicone vacuum grease present, this is normal.

This system is equipped with a vacuum pump which must be filled with oil prior to operation. There should be 1 ¼ quarts of mechanical vacuum pump oil present. If you look on the back of the system you can see a small oil view port. The oil must be halfway up the port. If not, ask a manager to help you refill it.

### Refilling the Oil (a Manager must be present for this):
1. The oil is added through the rear oval opening of the cabinet through an exhaust port.
1. Remove the copper elbow marked “oil filling port”.
1. Using the small funnel and hose, begin slowly adding the oil.
1. Several inches below the oval opening is a small oil view port. Keep adding the oil until the level is halfway up the oil view port.
1. Once the correct amount of oil is added, put the elbow back on the exhaust port.

A gas inlet is also provided for the introduction of pure gases (such as argon or dry nitrogen) for more uniform and oxygen free depositions. A regulated tank pressure of **5-15 psi** must be applied at the gas inlet. If deposition conditions are not critical for the sample, then the air inlet should be left free for the introduction of lab air.

## Operation
### Startup - First Pump Down:
1. First check that all the switches are off, and all the valves are closed before commencing operation with your Hummer. 
1. To place the Hummer in operation, set all controls as follows:
..- Main Power Switch: OFF
..- High Voltage Switch: OFF
..- Voltage Control: O
..- Process Control: MANUAL
..- Vent Valve: CLOSED
..- Pressure Control: DECREASE
..- Mode Selector: DC PLATE
1. Open the chamber by lifting the top plate or glass cylinder off and place your specimens on the pedestal.
1. Adjust the pedestal height to place the specimen approximately ¾ - 2’’ from the top plate electrode.
1. Loosen the pedestal height adjust knob (black plastic nut at base of pedestal rod)
1. Raise or lower the pedestal as required. Retighten the nut with your thumb and forefinger only.
1. Install desired electrode in the top plate by turning clockwise until tight.
1. After installing the electrode, place the top plate on the chamber and turn on the main power switch.
1. Wait about 15-20 minutes for the initial pump-down sequence to conclude. After than 2-5 minutes should be sufficient. Note: Pump-down is complete when a vacuum reading of 20 millitorr or less is obtained.
1. For best operation, especially with carbon electrodes, an inert gas (such as argon) should be attached via vacuum hose to the hose connector at the rear of the cabinet, and regulated to a pressure of 5-15 psi.

### Plate – General Operation:
Typical operating conditions are as follows:

**Gold or Gold/Palladium Deposition:**
- Pressure: 40-80 Millitorr (Argon)
- Current: 10 Milliamperes
- Voltage Control: Position 9 or 11
- Plate Time: 2 minutes

**Carbon Deposition:**
- Pressure: 40-80 Millitorr (Argon)
- Current: 10 Milliamperes
- Voltage Control: Position 11 or 12
- Plate Time: 10 minutes

To plate specimens, 
1. Set controls as follows,
..- Mode Switch: PLATE
..- High-voltage switch: ON
..- High-voltage knob: 11
..- Gas Valve: OPEN until vacuum reading is 80-100 millitorr.
1. It should be noted that the initial appearance of the plasma will cause the pressure in the chamber to rise and fall due to molecular adhesion of water vapor and atmospheric gases. Adjustment of the gas valve is necessary to compensate for these fluctuations until the pressure stabilizes. 
1. The Plasma will appear with a purple-blue glow.
1. Vary the pressure in the chamber with the fine metering valve to achieve reading of 5-15 milliampheres.
1. Set a timer to the desired number of minutes.
1. Turn switch to AUTO setting.
1. Note, the Plasma will terminate automatically after the number of minutes selected has expired.
1. Note, if the pulse mode is selected, timer totalizes only the ON cycle.
1. When your specimen has been coasted to the desired thickness set the controls as follows,
..- High-voltage control: ZERO
..- High-voltage switch: OFF 
..- Gas Valve: CLOSED
..- Main Power Switch: OFF
..- Vent Valve: OPEN
1. Lift the chamber top and remove your specimen from the chamber.

### Etch – Typical Operation:
Typical operating conditions are as follows:
**Metallurgical Specimen:**
- Pressure: 50-100 Millitorr (Argon)
- Current: 20 Milliamperes
- Voltage Control: Position 8, 9, or 10
- Etch Time: 6 - 10 minutes

To etch specimens, 
1. Set controls as follows,
..- Selector Switch: ETCH or CLEAN 
..- High-Voltage switch: ON
..- High-Voltage control: SIX
1. Open the fine metering valve until the vacuum reading is 50-70 millitorr. 
1. Once the plasma appears, adjust the current to 10 milliamperes or less by using this valve for biological or organic samples and from 10-30 for inorganic samples.

### Plasma Processing:
Plasma Processing is utilized for ashing, cleaning, and etching of metals, ceramics, glasses, organics, and composites. This is a chemical-physical variation as opposed to the DC Etching (Sputter Etching) which is a physical reaction by ion bombardment. The specimens are reacted with active species of oxygen, carbon tetrafluoride or other reactive gas. In addition, organic and inorganic coasting can be deposited by Plasma chemical vapor deposition (CVD).

Typical operating conditions are as follows:
**Ashing – Cleaning – Etching of Organic and Carbon**
- Pressure: 1 torr (oxygen)
- Current: 20 Milliamperes
- Voltage Control: Position 6
- Time: 10 minutes

**Etching of Metals, Ceramics, and Glasses**
- Pressure: 500 Millitorr (CF4)
- Current: 20 Milliamperes
- Voltage Control: Position 4
- Time: 5 minutes
*NOTE: Vent exhaust from room!*

**Deposition of Ethylene Polymers**
- Pressure: 500 Millitorr (Ethylene)
- Current: 20 Milliamperes
- Voltage Control: Position 5
- Time: 15 minutes

**Cross Linking of Organics (A or N2)**
- Pressure: 100 Millitorr
- Current: 10 Milliamperes
- Voltage Control: Position 6
- Time: 10 minutes

To begin Plasma Processing, 
1. Set controls as follows,
..- Mode Selector Switch: Plasma Exc.
..- Main Power Switch: ON
1. Evacuate the system to 20 millitorr
1. Increase the Gas Valve to read a pressure of 1 torr
1. Place the High-Voltage Switch to ON
1. Increase Voltage Control to produce a current of 20 milliampheres on the current meter.
1. Process for desired time with desired gas;
- Oxygen for cleaning, ashing, and etching of organics.
- Carbon tetrafluoride for etching of metals, ceramics, and glasses. *NOTE: Vent Toxic Fumes*.
- Ethylene for deposition of ethylene coatings.
- Argon or Nitrogen for cross linking of organic surfaces such as TEM and SEM specimens to improve stability to electron beam exposure.

## Shutdown
1. Turn off the main power switch.
1. Set all controls as follows:
..- Main Power Switch: OFF
..- High Voltage Switch: OFF
..- Voltage Control: O
..- Process Control: MANUAL
..- Vent Valve: CLOSED
..- Pressure Control: DECREASE
..- Mode Selector: DC PLATE
1. Remove the top plate from the chamber and verify that all specimens are removed from the system.

Check to see that no foreign material is shorting an electrode to the annular space shield surrounding the electrode. <br /> 3. Make sure that no foreign material is lodged between the pedestal and the surrounding annular sace shield. <br /> 4. Be sure that the pedestal, electrode, and space shields are not excessively coated or dirty, especially when selecting etch mode. |
| *Plasma is present, but no coating can be achieved.*  | *1. Be sure voltage is in operating range. <br /> 2. Make certain that electrodes are serviceable by insuring that they are clean and free of surface contamination. <br /> 3. Check to see that the inside of the glass chamber and all fixtures inside the vacuum chamber are clean, to prevent degassing and contamination of the coating. <br /> 4. Purge the chamber of contaminating gases by continually bleeding in and pumping out chamber with inert gas (argon).*  |
| Pulse mode will not work.  | Replace the delay relay located at right rear inside of power supply.  |
| *Vacuum gauge will not work.*  | *1. Check power connection between vacuum gauge and rear of power supply. <br /> 2. Check connection between vacuum gauge tube. <br /> 3. Replace gauge and tube as matched set.*  |

### Maintenance (Managers Only): 
*Cleaning:*
Many component parts become coated with material. The chambers should be cleaned with water and Bon-Ami cleanser. The pedestal and shields surrounding the pedestal and electrode can be removed and scrubbed with steel wool and then washed with detergent and water. Metallic electrodes can be cleaned with acetone or perchloroethylene. Carbon electrodes should be cleaned with steel wool or emery paper.

The exterior of the instrument should be kept clean by wiping with a damp cloth and spray cleaner. Avoid excessive scrubbing on the front panels and controls.

*Grease:*
Thee seals should be kept coated with a very light film of silicone vacuum grease. The electrodes are actually consumed during the coating process and will take on a matte appearance when worn, usually after 100 to 1200 depositions. Disc type electrodes are easily removed by unscrewing directly from beneath the top plate. 

*Adjustments:* 
The pressure interlock is used to prevent the high voltage from operating unless the chamber is under vacuum; this interlock switch is suspended vertically beneath the base plate and can be seen through the oval opening at the cabinet rear. This switch is an important safety feature and has been adjusted so that the high-voltage is off when the chamber is vented, and on when the chamber is evacuated. A small adjusting screw is provided for this adjustment. Backing the screw out will allow the high-voltage to come on at a higher pressure and advancing the screw will have the opposite effect. 

After long periods of use, the packing around the vent valve may become worn and the valve will feel loose. This tightness can be restored by first loosening the jam nut on the valve body located just behind the panel, and then tightening the chrome compression nut located just in front of the panel. This valve should then be repositioned and held in place by retightening the jam nut against rear of the panel. 

The vacuum pumps normally don’t require attention other than to check the oil. The oil should be drained and refilled when pressures below 30 mt cannot be achieved with a good quality mechanical vacuum pump oil, a drain cock for this purpose is provided at the front-left corner of the pump. The lower panel should be removed first. Oil capacity is 1 ¼ quarts, be sure to not overfill.
