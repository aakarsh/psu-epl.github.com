## Machine Safety
- Do not switch the tungsten bulb on at high intensity.
- Using this machine for long periods of time can create eye strain. 

## How to Get Help
Ask an ETL Manager if you have any questions.

# Using this Machine
These sections describe the standard usage and common pitfalls.

## Operation
1. Place a specimen on the mechanical stage. 
1. Adjust the stage height. 
1. Switch on the transformer. 
1. Swing the 10X objective into the light path and coarse focus. 
1. Make interpupillary and diopter adjustments. 
1. Swing in the desired objective. 
1. Fine focus. 
1. Correct the illumination system. 
1. Adjust light intensity. 
1. Adjust aperture iris diaphragm and field iris diaphragm. 

### Level a Specimen
1. Put plasticine on a metal slide supplied.  
1. Place a piece of tissue paper between the specimen and the plunger of the hand press in order to prevent scratching of the polished specimen surface. If there is no tissue paper available, use gloves.
1. Place a specimen on the plasticine, and press the specimen with a hand press until the specimen surface is properly leveled.

### Interpupillary Distance and Diopter Adjustments
1. Hold the knurled dovetail slides of the right and left eyepiece tubes with both hands and push the tubes together, or pull them apart laterally, whichever is required, while looking through the eyepieces with both eyes, until perfect binocular vision is obtained. 
1. Memorize or write down your interpupillary distance setting as seen on the scale. 
1. Rotate the tube length adjustment ring on the right eyepiece tube to match your interpupillary distance setting which you obtained from the scale (i.e. prior step). 
1. Look at the image through the right eyepiece with your right eye and focus on the specimen with the fine adjustment knobs. 
1. Next, look at the image through the left eyepiece with your left eye and rotate the tube length adjustment right to focus on the specimen without using the coarse and fine adjustment knobs. 

Note: The mechanical tube length of the microscope is standardized at 200mm.

### Light Path Selection 
The trinocular observation tube is provided with a light path selector level to direct the light to the observation tube or to the photo tube. You will need to adjust the light path depending on your project needs. In case of long time exposure, it is necessary to darken the room or put a pair of light shield caps, provided with the trinocular tube, on the eyepiece tubes, in order to prevent light from coming on the film plane. 

The light path options are as follows,
- If the lever is pushed in all the way you will receive 100% of light into the binocular tube. This light is recommended for normal observation or dark specimens.
- If the lever is pulled out all the way then you will receive 20% of light into the binocular tube and 80% into the photo tube. This is recommended for photomicrography and observation of excessively bright specimens.

### Focusing Adjustment


## Shutdown
1. Lower light intensity.
1. Switch off the transformer.

## Cleanup
Remove your specimen from the mechanical stage and clean up your workspace.

# Tips and Tricks

## Assembly (Manager's Only)
For assembly, the picture below illustrates the sequential procedure. The numbers indicate the order of assebmly of various components. Remove dust caps before mounting components. Take care to keep all glass surfaces clean, and avoid scratching the glass surfaces.
