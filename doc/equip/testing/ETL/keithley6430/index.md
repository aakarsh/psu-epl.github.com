## General Notes:
**SOP Under Construction**

Keithley 6430: The four-quadrant sourcing plus measurement sensitivity down to sub-femtoamp and micro-volt levels. Remote PreAmp design minimizes cable and noise effects that reduce measurement accuracy. Measures currents with 400aA (400*10^-18) sensitivity. Allows measuring resistance with either the constant-voltage or constant-current method. Measures resistances from 1 micro-ohm to >1 Tera-ohm.
