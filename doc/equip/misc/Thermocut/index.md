# About this Machine
Cuts Styrofoam and thermoplastic materials fast! The working surface is of Alu Cobond compound. This eases the pushing of work pieces. A printed grid and protractor are applied to the base.

The large table with 15 11/32" x 11" (390 x 280mm) ensures smooth and easy movement of the work piece. The printed grid and protractor assist with division and cutting. The solid aluminum overarm has a 13 3/4" (350mm) throat and offers 5 1/2" (140mm) in height. The holder and wire coil (one spool of wire 98ft., 0.008" diameter is included) may be shifted and adjusted along the overarm to enable miter cutting.

 It looks like the wire diameter is actually 0.006", as measured.

## Setup
Make sure the wire is clean and the working surface is clear before plugging in and powering on.

## Operation
When you are ready to begin cutting flip on the switch to heat the wire and adjust the temperature to meet your project requirements. You may adjust the arm in various ways to act as a guide for cutting.

The correct temperature, being material and thickness dependent, is learned from experience. Profiles are ideally cut at lower temperatures and while applying less cutting force. 

## Shutdown
Make sure to flip off the power switch before unplugging.

## Cleanup
Ensure that the wire is cooled down before cleaning up! Wipe down the working surface and wire.
