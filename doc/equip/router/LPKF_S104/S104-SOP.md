## Log Into the Host Computer and Connect to the S104

1. Log into the host computer.

The log in information should be on the monitor. If it is not, ask a manager on duty.

2. Launch LPKF CircuitPro PM 2.7.

3. Connect Circuit Pro to the S104.

CircuitPro should attempt to connect to the S104 automatically. Be patient, it might take a few minutes. When it has finished connecting, it will go to the template selection menu.

Sometimes, CircuitPro might not attempt to connect to the S104. In that case, it will proceed directly to the template selection menu. We will connect to it manually in a moment.

Choose the appropriate template for your project. This will likely be SingleSided_Top, SingleSided_Bottom, or DoubleSided_NoTHP.
