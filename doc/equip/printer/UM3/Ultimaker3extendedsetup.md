## Setup

-   The printer will guide you through the initial setup process. Controls are very similar to the Ultimaker 2
-   Step 1: inserting the printer cores.
    -   Gently press down on the front facing fan housing to open the printer core housing.
    -   Insert the printer core by squeezing together the front plastic tabs and sliding the printer core into the desired slot. Firmly press the core into place until you hear a small click. The machine will auto detect the printer core being used.
-   Step 2: Loading the print material.
    -   Load the material for print core #2 first.
    -   Follow a similar material loading procedure to the Ultimaker 2
    -   Load the spool for print core #1 and attach the guide arm to the end of the spool holder
    -   The machine will guide you through the process.
-   Step 3: Leveling the build plate
    -   System &gt; Build plate &gt; Manual Leveling
    -   Follow directions on the machine to level the build plate and set the Z-offset
