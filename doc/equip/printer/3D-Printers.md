Hwhwhwhwh what am I typing good gosh golly 

Do you have a 3D print you want to have made?  Queue it up with us and then come and get it when its ready.  To do this you will need a couple of things.
 
1. You will need a .stl version of your part or widget.
2. You will need to know the approximate dimensions of your part or widget (ie it is 2.1" at the extreme in the z axis)
3. You will need to send an email with your .stl, dimensions, printer to use (use the wiki to look up the 3 different printers we have), color of material (refer to machine wiki page), solid part or partial fill, and level of detail of part (use 1-5 with 5 being the highest detail) to lid@pdx.edu
4. You will receive an email with cost and approximate time before it is done.
