This is an alpha version of the SOP.


## Getting Started

The EPL has a Shining3D EinScan-SP Desktop 3D Scanner. It is able to scan a volume between 30×30×30 mm and 200×200×200mm automatically on the turntable, or 1200 ×1200×1200mm manually using a fixed mount.

1. Insert the calibration board into the board holder.
2. Place the calibration board and board holder onto the center of the turntable, facing the scanner.
3. Open the software as instructed in the Getting Started section aboves. Select EinScan-SP as the scanner model and go to NEXT. ~~Getting started with calibration button,~~ following the on-screen instructions to turn the calibration board in 3 directions. 
NOTE: Only rotate the calibration board during calibration, not at other times.
