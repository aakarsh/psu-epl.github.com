Welcome to the EPL! We’re excited you’re getting started with
the Formlabs 3D printer. This guide will provide a walkthrough
for how to safely and efficiently use the Formlabs 3D printer so
you can get going with your project. If you have any additional
questions, please ask any EPL student managers for help, or
email us at EPL@pdx.edu.

## Printing:
Begin by opening the PreForm software located in the start menu on the workstation (eplmulti) near the formlabs machine.

Open your STL or OBJ files.

Most parts print better when support at an angle. For automatic set-up select “One Click Print.”, PreForm will then use the sequence of tools to “orient all”, “generate all”, and “layout all.”. If you would like to do this manually use the FormLab tools to adjust the model “Oriention”, generate the “Supports”, and adjust the “Layout”. Most parts print better when the model is in the center; If possible keep the model layout in the center of the print bed.

Once you have the model set-up, check for Printability. If your model has unsupported areas your print may fail; rotate the model around and look for any red areas like the screenshot below,

To correct this issue click on the PreForm tool "Supports", "Edit Supports", add in support points until the red area is eliminated, and click "Apply" to save the changes.

Your model is print ready!

Confirm your print's material and layer height, then click the orange print icon. Select which printer to upload the file to from the printer dialogue. Be sure to save your .form file into the queue folder.

*Remember to save your stl or obj files to your folder on the eplulti computer and add your print information into the queue.*
