EPL managers get 24-hour key card access to the EPL, which is fun. 
However, there are responsibilities that come with the position, and some hoops to jump through. 
Here's what you need to know.

## Responsibilities for Any Manager
- __Keep people and equipment safe.__ This is a manager's most important responsibility.
- Manage the lab for 2 hours a week between our open/close times (9:00 AM to 9:00 PM Mon thru Fri). During the breaks and summer term, project and internship/job time can be used in lieu of some/all lab hours.
- Train students on machines in the lab.
- Run the student store.
	- Handle locker purchases.
	- Sell parts.
	- Help people find and interpret documentation.
	- Put together any lab kits.
	- Sort new/donated parts.
	- Assist the store director.
- Sign PSU volunteer paperwork.
- Attend 1 manager meeting a month and read all meeting notes. Meetings are ever other week.
- Keep the lab clean and orderly.

## Steps to Become a Manager

- Send an email to the current EPL administrator (currently Chris) at lid@pdx.edu establishing yourself as a candidate for manager. This email should include a little info about yourself. The lab admin will then send you an application to fill out. The date that the application is filled out will be your start date. 
- Finish being trained on all of the equipment that's currently being used. You will also need to be trained in all of the store operations. You have approximately 30 days from your application date to train on all of the equipment. 
- Once done with all training email the admin at epl@pdx.edu or at their personal email address (in this case Chris Clark at cjclark@pdx.edu). They will then complete the process. 
- Don't get vetoed. The admin will email the current manager group and let everyone know you're about to become a new manager. Any current manager can veto someone trying to become a manager. This may sound arbitrary, but it's not. It's specifically to prevent people who aren't good with other people or with equipment from becoming managers. Becoming a manager is a big responsibility and means keeping people safe, being responsible, and contributing to the community. Some people just aren't ready for that yet.
- Get briefed by the administrator. The admin will meet with you and go over becoming a manager. This takes about an hour.

## Paid Managers

After 6 months as a volunteer manager, you can apply to become a paid manager. [The instructions to do this are here][paid managers].
Paid managers get more lab hours and responsibilities, including a specific lab role. They also get paid. 
Students eligible for work study should seriously consider becoming paid managers.
